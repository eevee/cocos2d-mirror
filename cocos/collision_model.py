class CollisionManager(object):

    Role: answer questions about proximity or collision with known objects

    Objects must comply with:
        . obj has a member called cshape
        . obj.cshape supports the interface Cshape
        . as a limitation imposed by the current Cshapes implementations, a
        unique concrete Cshape is allowed across all objects know by a
        CollisionManager instance.
        By example, all objects should have a CircleShape cshape, or all
        objects should have a AARectShape cshape.

    CollisionManager don't automatically tracks changes in obj.cshape, it is
    user code responsability to update the collision manager instance when
    obj.cshape values changes. (By example, if obj position changes) 
    Eficient ways of doing this are:

    General use case:

    The game level will have a CollisionManager instance, lets call it collman.
    Then at each frame you do:
        . call collman.clear  (it will empty collision manager)
        . call collman.add for all collidable actors still alive
        . do the game logic, asking all the questions you want about collision;
        . as part of the frame update, each object should end with an updated
        cshape.

    Special case optimization:
    
    If lot of the objects are static and only a *few* dynamic ones needs to
    interact with the statics, the best is to have two collision managers:
    one for the static objects, the other for all dynamics objects.
    Then, when starting a level:
        add the static collidables to collman_static
    In each frame:
        . call collman_dynamic.clear
        . add to collman_dynamic all the dynamic collidables
        . do the game logic, use remove_tricky to remove in collman_static
        . as part of the frame update, each dynamic should end with an updated
        cshape.

    An example of this situation is an arcade game with lots of enemies and
    lots of goodies (food, coins, powerups) where the goodies are static and
    only interacts with player.
    goodies-player interaction will use collman_goodies.objs_colliding(player),
    player-enemies interactions will use collman_dynamic.

    Note that the few dynamics that interacts with statics are not added to
    collman_static.
    Also, there can be lots of dynamics, whenever only a few interacts with the
    statics.
