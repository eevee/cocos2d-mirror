Can I use 3D objects in cocos2d ?
---------------------------------

Yes. cocos2d uses `pyglet`_ / OpenGL so you can 
use 3D objects and use them within cocos2d.

You can include some 3D objects in your 2d game
to improve the quality of your graphics without any problem.

Also, the default projection matrix of cocos2d is a 3D one,
so probably you won't need to change it. But you can override 
the projection matrix by registering to the ``director on_resize``
event. See the `test/test_custom_on_resize.py` code as an example.

To enable OpenGL depth test, you can call Director's `set_depth_test` method.

Also, remember that cocos2d focus on 2D games, so if you want
to create a full-blown 3D game, `Panda3d`_ will suit you best.


Can I use cocos2d's sprites and actions without the rest of the framework ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short answer: **No**.
Long answer: **Yes**.

Almost everthing in cocos2d is `CocosNode` object (``sprites``, ``layers``,
``scenes``, etc...), so the easiest way to use cocos2d's sprites (or any
other `CocosNode` object) is to port `CocosNode` to your project.

Since `CocosNode` uses director's `get_window_size` method, you shall create
a Director stub in your project that implements `get_window_size`.
You shall also call the `CocosNode.visit` method from your main loop to draw
the sprites.

Although I haven't tried it, I think this shall work ok. If it doesn't work,
let us know.
