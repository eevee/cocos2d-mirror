Introduction
============

Cocos2d is a framework for building games, demos, and other
graphical/interactive applications. It is built over `pyglet`_ .
It provides some conventions and classes to help you structure a 
"scene based application".

A cocos2d application consists of several scenes, and a workflow
connecting the different scenes. It provides you a director
(a singleton) which handles that workflow between scenes.
Each scenes is composed of an arbitrary number of layers;
Layers take care about drawing to the screen (using the pyglet and OpenGL APIs),
handle events and in general contain all of the game/application logic.

Cocos2d simplifies the game development in these areas:
 - Defining a workflow for your game
 - Composing scenes and scenes components
 - Creating special effects & transitions in and between scenes
 - Managing tiled maps
 - Managing sprites
 - Basic Menus
 - and more
