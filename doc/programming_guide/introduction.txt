Introduction
============

Cocos2d is a framework for building games, demos, and other
graphical/interactive applications. It is built over `pyglet`_ .
It provides some conventions and classes to help you structure a 
"scene based application".

A cocos2d application consists of several `Scenes`, and a workflow
connecting the different scenes. It provides you a `Director`
(a singleton) which handles that workflow between `Scenes`.
Each `Scene` is composed of an arbitrary number of `Layers`;
`Layers` take care about drawing to the screen (using the pyglet and OpenGL APIs),
handle events and in general contain all of the game/application logic.

Cocos2d simplifies the game development in these areas:
 * Defining a workflow for your game
 * Composing `Scenes` and `Scene` components
 * Creating special effects & transitions in and between scenes
 * Managing `Sprites`
 * Basic `Menus`
 * and more
