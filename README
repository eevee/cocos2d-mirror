version: 0.2.0
This version works OK with pyglet 1.1a1 (or newer)
If you want to use pyglet 1.0, use cocos v0.1.x instead.

HOW TO:

   $ cd samples
   $ python RUN_ALL_THE_SAMPLES.py
     ( and read the samples source code )

 * run the test (they are very interesting )
   $ cd test
   $ python RUN_ALL_THE_TEST.py
     ( and read the samples source code )
