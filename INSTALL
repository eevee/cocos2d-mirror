How to install cocos2d
----------------------

First,
 Install python 2.4 with ctypes, python 2.5 or python 2.6

Then:
 Install pyglet 1.1.4 or newer ( http://www.pyglet.org )

 Pyglet audio is included in the Pyglet binary package for windows and mac, see
 the pyglet page if you are on linux

 If you want to use the optional SDL audio, you will need
	- in windows, the pygame package, http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
	- for other operating systems, ???
 
Finally:
 Get the source package at
 http://code.google.com/p/los-cocos/downloads/list

 While you are at it you can download the most up to date docs and samples.

 Cocos is a pure python package, so the usual ways will work.
 Note that cocos documentation and examples are not included in the source
 package, there are a separate download.
 
 unpack the source package and run
 setup.py install

or:

 Copy "cocos" dir to your project

$ cp -r cocos $PROJECT_HOME

or:

include cocos in your PYTHONPATH

$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/cocos

or:

 insert cocos in sys.path

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, PATH_TO_COCOS))
