How to install cocos2d
----------------------

First,
 Install python 2.6, python 2.5 or python 2.4
 For python 2.4 you will need two extra packages:
   - ctypes, http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ctypes
   - elementtree, http://effbot.org/downloads/#elementtree

Then:
 Install pyglet 1.1.4 or newer ( http://www.pyglet.org )

 Pyglet audio is included in the Pyglet binary package for windows and mac, see
 the pyglet page if you are on linux

 If you want to use the optional SDL audio, you will need
	- in windows, the pygame package, http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
	- for other operating systems, ???
 
Finally:
 Get the source package at
 http://code.google.com/p/los-cocos/downloads/list

 Cocos is a pure python package, so the usual ways will work.
 Note that cocos documentation and examples are included in the source
 package.
 
 unpack the source package and:

 from the unpacked directory move the directories doc/html, test, samples,
 utest to the location when you usually store lib extra info.
 

 and then run
 setup.py install

or:

 Copy "cocos" dir to your project

$ cp -r cocos $PROJECT_HOME

or:

include cocos in your PYTHONPATH

$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/cocos

or:

 insert cocos in sys.path

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, PATH_TO_COCOS))
