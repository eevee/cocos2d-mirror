How to install Cocos
--------------------

We didn't have time to code and test a setup.py so,
here are the steps to install cocos in your
machine:


1) Copy "cocos" to your project

$ cp -r cocos $PROJECT_HOME


2) Or include cocos in your PYTHONPATH

$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/cocos


3) Or insert cocos in sys.path

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, PATH_TO_COCOS))
